    "\n",
    "You will need to install Python 3 and Jupyter notebooks first in order to view this notebook file. To get Python 3, head over to [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install the most-recent version available for your computer. If you use a package manager for Linux (e.g. apt-get), MacOS (e.g. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)), or Windows (e.g. [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)), you can use that to install Python 3 as well. Please see their resepctive websites for more info on how to do that."

    "### 0. OPTIONAL --- Use a Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a virtual environment if you wish. Virtual environments make it easier to organize all your project's dependencies and packages. In Python 3, venv/virtualenv, pipenv, and autoenv are available among many others. I will show you how to use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), which is built on top of venv/virtualenv.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install virtualenvwrapper\n",
    "Type the following into your console:\n",
    "```pip install virtualenvwrapper``` <br />\n",
    "If you are on a Windows machine, instead, do ```pip install virtualenvwrapper-win```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Create appropriate directories\n",
    "Create a directory in your home folder to contain all of your virtual environments. In your console, just type ```mdkir ~/Envs```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Run script on startup\n",
    "Edit your ```~/.bashrc``` file to include the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs\n",
    "source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, everytime you start a new console, virtualenvwrapper will be set and ready to go! Note: this step will probably be different on Windows. Please head over to this [site](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for instructions and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Learn commands\n",
    " - ```mkvirtualenv [env_name]``` creates a new virtual environment with the specified name.\n",
    " - ```workon [env_name]``` to start working on a new virtual environment with the specified name.\n",
    " - ```lsvirtualenv``` lists all the virtual environments that you have created.\n",
    " - ```deactivate``` stops working in the current virutal environment.\n",
    " \n",
    " There are more commands available that you can find online, but this is enough to get you started."
